Synthesis:
It is the process of converting RTL Verilog code of your RISC-V design into a gate-level netlist and it maps your digital logic into standard cells from the Sky130 PDK.

Tools Used:
Yosys - reads RTL, optimizes design
ABC - performs technology mapping

- After running a successful synthesis, some reports will be generated. Those generated reports will be displayed in the image synthesis_1.png 

Synthesis Summary:
Design Name: RISC-V
Total cells: 14876
tns - 759.46
wns - 24.89
