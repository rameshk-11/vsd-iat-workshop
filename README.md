# VSD_IAT RTL to GDS II Workshop- Sky130 PDK
Author: Ramesh Kalidindi

Design name: RISC-V

Technology: SkyWater 130nm(Sky130)

Course name: Digital VLSI SoC Design

Tools Used: OpenLane, Yosys, Openroad, Magic

This repository contains my work and documentation of Digital VLSI SoC Design workshop. The project implements a RISC-V based design taken through the complete physical design flow.

During this project, I've implemented the complete ASIC flow:

1.Synthesis

2.Floorplanning

3.Placement

4.Clock Tree Synthesis

5.Routing

6.Static TIming Analysis

7.Layout Generation

8.GDS II and sign-off checks
